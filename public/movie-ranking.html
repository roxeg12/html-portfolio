<h1>A Complete and Completely Unbiased Guide to Stray Kids' Discography. By me.</h1>
<h2>Basically me ranking my fav songs and giving recs</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Insomnia</h3>
<p>
    Actually a masterpiece in the most simple way. Perfectly encapsulates the feeling of desperation
    when you are exhausted and trying to sleep but just cannot for no good reason. Very relateable to 
    me personally, and always hits.

<h3>2. Phobia</h3>
<p>
    Another masterpiece. Another song demonstrating how well skz (3racha really) 
    can convey emotion and feeling of a specific situation through music. And the BRIDGE. Insane.
</p>

<h3>3. Sunshine</h3>
<p>
    The most peaceful and grounding song ever. The perfect calm yet interesting song to study to
    or even sleep to. Personally I always feel really grounded and aware of the world in a strange way when 
    I listen to it, like I really come back into my body and mind.
