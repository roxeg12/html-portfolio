<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a sophomore at Rice University studying Computer Science and Cognitive Sciences. </p>

<h2>Neurotech@Rice</h2>
<p>As a member of our software subteam, I have contributed to the processing of raw EEG data, training a machine learning model on that data,
  and writing code using that model's output from live EEG readings to control a drone. This is a project using technology that has massive 
  applicability to existing problems; using emerging biocybernetic technology, we could create hands-free wheelchairs, mechanical prosthetics,
  or a new level to virtual reality.

<h2>Hobbies:</h2>
<p>I love love love to dance, specifically hip-hop, or the occasional kpop. I also really enjoy other ways of moving my body, like weightlifting,
  running, cycling, and hiking. On a lazy day though, you would probably find me with my nose buried in a book, watching a kdrama, or coding (ha.) 
  a random project.
